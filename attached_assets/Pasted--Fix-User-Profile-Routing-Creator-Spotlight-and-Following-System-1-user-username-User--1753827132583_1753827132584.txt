 Fix User Profile Routing, Creator Spotlight, and Following System
🧍‍♂️ 1. /user/:username = "User Not Found" Bug
❌ Issue: Visiting /user/:username shows "User not found", even if the user exists.

✅ Fix:

Backend route (e.g. GET /api/user/:username) must:

Search using case-insensitive match.

Return user object including: { id, username, displayName, avatar, bio, stats }

Frontend:

Ensure username is extracted from route param correctly.

If no user found, render friendly 404 — only if confirmed null, not just undefined during loading.

🌟 2. Creator Spotlight: Can Follow Yourself
❌ Issue: Users can follow themselves via Creator Spotlight.

✅ Fix:

In the "Follow" button logic:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (user.id === spotlightUser.id) hideFollowButton();
👤 3. Clicking Creator Spotlight → /user/:username is Broken
❌ Issue: Clicking spotlight user navigates to /user/:username, which errors.

✅ Fix:

Ensure the click action does:

ts
Copy
Edit
router.push(`/user/${encodeURIComponent(user.username)}`);
Confirm spotlight data includes valid username field.

🔁 4. Implement Real User Following System
✅ Backend:

POST /api/follow:

ts
Copy
Edit
{
  followerId,
  followingId
}
Add entry to follows table/collection.

DELETE /api/unfollow

GET /api/user/:id/following

GET /api/user/:id/followers

✅ Frontend:

When visiting a user profile:

Show Follow or Unfollow depending on logged-in user’s relationship.

Update button state and counts optimistically on click.

Track follower/following count in user stats.

📱 Example User Object (After Fixes)
ts
Copy
Edit
{
  id: "u123",
  username: "mangaKing",
  displayName: "Manga King",
  avatar: "/avatars/mangaking.png",
  bio: "I make comics!",
  stats: {
    followers: 209,
    following: 42,
    chaptersRead: 580
  },
  isFollowing: true, // <-- if logged-in user is following
}
✅ Final Result
/user/:username loads reliably and dynamically.

Creator Spotlight is fully interactive but prevents self-follow.

User following system works across platform.

User stats are accurate and updatable.
