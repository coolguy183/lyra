🔧 FINAL FIX PROMPT — Profile Stats, Novel System, Reader UX, Comments, Ad Dashboard
📊 1. Profile Stats (Fix: Real Data)
Current data is mock/fake (e.g., reading streak, chapters read, series followed, views this week).

🔁 Replace with real backend data from reading activity and interactions.

✅ Examples:

"Chapters Read This Week" → count from fully-read chapters (scroll 100%).

"Reading Streak" → track consecutive days with at least 1 chapter read.

“Total Likes Given” → from chapter/series likes.

“Series Followed” → live count, not hardcoded.

📖 2. Novel Chapters (Fix: Input & Output)
Currently uses image uploads like manga/webtoon — incorrect for novels.

✅ Change to:

Markdown Text Editor for input (e.g., react-markdown-editor-lite, TipTap, etc.).

Reader should render styled markdown, with headings, bold, lists, etc.

Do not store as image blobs, store text content.

🧭 3. Reader UI Behavior (Fix: Scroll Detection)
Currently:

Reader UI does not disappear when scrolling.

Or disappears too quickly.

✅ Correct behavior (like MangaDex):

Reader UI (top/bottom overlays) should disappear when scrolling down.

Stay visible until scroll resumes, or user taps screen again.

Add a manual toggle button to show/hide menu.

💬 4. Comments (Fix Show + Submit Crash)
Show Comments button still crashes or does nothing.

commentMutation error still occurs.

✅ Fix:

Properly define commentMutation with useMutation() hook.

Ensure commentText is state-bound, commentMutation.mutate({ text }) sends correct payload.

Re-fetch comments on success.

Render comment thread under chapter.

📈 5. Ad Dashboard Unlock (Feature Implementation)
Ad dashboard should unlock when a series reaches 1000 followers.

✅ Requirements:

Add a check on creator dashboard:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (series.followers >= 1000) showAdDashboard = true;
Display dashboard tab/button for eligible creators only.

Allow:

Ad impressions & click tracking.

Revenue analytics.

Ad settings (enable/disable, sponsor messages, etc.)
