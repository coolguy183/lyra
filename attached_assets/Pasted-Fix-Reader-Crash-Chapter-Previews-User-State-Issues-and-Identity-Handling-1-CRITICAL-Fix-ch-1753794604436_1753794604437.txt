Fix Reader Crash, Chapter Previews, User State Issues, and Identity Handling
⚠️ 1. [CRITICAL] Fix chapter Initialization Error in Reader
tsx
Copy
Edit
[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] Cannot access 'chapter' before initialization
🔧 Ensure chapter is defined before use in useEffect.

Example fix:

tsx
Copy
Edit
useEffect(() => {
  if (chapter) {
    setLikeCount(chapter.likeCount || 0);
  }
}, [chapter]);
Or safely guard it by:

tsx
Copy
Edit
const likeCount = chapter?.likeCount ?? 0;
📷 2. Add Chapter Preview Image (Webtoon Style)
On /series/[id] page, each chapter item should:

Display first image of the chapter as a thumbnail.

Use chapter.images?.[0] or similar if available.

If empty, fallback to "No Preview" placeholder.

Add metadata:

❤️ Likes

👀 Views

💬 Comments count

🔗 3. Fix Share Button (Series & Chapter)
Implement share functionality:

Open modal popup with:

📋 Copy link

📤 Share to Twitter, Reddit, Discord

Use navigator.share if available.

🧩 4. Remove Random 0 Below Genre Tags
This issue likely comes from an accidental .map() or length call:

Example: series.genres.length || 0 rendering incorrectly.

Ensure only tags are rendered, and extra 0 is removed.

📈 5. Fix Reading Progress Tracking
On chapter scroll complete (or 100% read):

Save progress:

✅ Chapter marked as read

✅ Update "Read This Week" & "Reading Streak" in user profile

✅ Optional: store timestamps

Store in database or at least localStorage fallback

🧷 6. Fix Follow & Bookmark State
Properly persist:

✅ Follow toggles to Unfollow after action

✅ Bookmark toggles to Remove from Library

States should not reset on reload.

Backend must return correct follow/bookmark status for logged-in user.

🧑 7. [CRITICAL] Replace All userId with username Site-Wide
Replace:

/user/:userId → /user/:username

comment.author → use author.username

Review, chapter, and series authors must all use username display.

Update links and UI to use readable username.

🗣️ 8. Review Logic Fix
Only allow one review per user per series.

If a user has already reviewed:

Show their existing review with edit/delete options.
