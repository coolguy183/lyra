🧭 Reader Page Fixes
Reader UI should not auto-hide every few seconds; only hide on scroll.

If menu is toggled via click, it should stay visible until the user scrolls again.

Comments section in the reader must be restored under the chapter view.

Like and View counts on chapters must update the total likes/views of the entire series (tracked cumulatively).

Fix Follow/Unfollow toggle so that:

When user follows, the button stays as "Unfollow".

State persists on reload without needing another API call.

🛠️ Creator Dashboard Fixes
In chapter creation, add ability to reorder chapters via drag-and-drop.

In the Series Overview tab:

Redesign the UI with a clean layout and readable formatting (title, genre, cover, status, synopsis, etc.).

Enable editing chapters via the existing buttons (they don’t work currently).

On creator’s series list, when hovering over a series card, change “Read Now” → “Manage”.

In chapter creation for novels, use a Markdown editor (like react-markdown-editor-lite) instead of image upload.

In the reader, novel chapters should render markdown properly (headings, paragraphs, italics, links, etc.).

👤 Profile + User System Fixes
User profiles are not updating — fix user data syncing with:

Reading progress (like % of chapter read)

Streaks

Chapters read this week

User routes and references must use usernames, not raw userId.

All places where comments/reviews show userId should correctly display the username.

Routes like /user/:userId should instead be /user/:username, and lookup should use username.

Fix broken "User Not Found" issue when visiting user pages.

📝 Series Page Fixes
If current user is the author, show an "Edit Series" button next to the title or near the cover.

Remove the mysterious "0" under genre tags.

Ensure share buttons work and generate shareable links.

Chapter items must show:

Proper preview image (first page of the chapter),

Like count, views, release date.

Bookmark/follow buttons must reflect correct state across reloads (no reset).
